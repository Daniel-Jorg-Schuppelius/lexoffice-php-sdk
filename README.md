# Lexoffice PHP SDK

Inspired by the project [eike-grundke/lexoffice-php-sdk](https://github.com/helsinki-systems/lexoffice-php-sdk), I have given some thought to what I would do differently. Initially, I wanted to create a fork, but I decided against it as I have completely overhauled the original structure.

The SDK is licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE). Feel free to contribute!

## Using the SDK

The SDK requires a PHP version of 8.1 or higher. The recommended way to install the SDK is through [Composer](http://getcomposer.org).
