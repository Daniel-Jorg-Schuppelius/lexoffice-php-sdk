# Lexoffice PHP SDK

Inspired by the project [eike-grundke/lexoffice-php-sdk](https://github.com/helsinki-systems/lexoffice-php-sdk), I have given some thought to what I would do differently. Initially, I wanted to create a fork, but I decided against it as I have completely overhauled the original structure.

The SDK is licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE). Feel free to contribute!

## Using the SDK

Basic functions for controlling the endpoints are included in the SDK. A little more fine-tuning is needed for validation when creating the objects in lexoffice.

### Install the SDK into your Project

The SDK requires a PHP version of 8.1 or higher. The recommended way to install the SDK is through [Composer](http://getcomposer.org).

```bash
composer require daniel-jorg-schuppelius/lexoffice-php-sdk
```
